### What I learned

Hi, while coding this project I got a whole new perception of approaching development.
especially with that
```css
.product__img div {
  position: absolute;
  background-color: rgb(0, 255, 247, 0.5);
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
}
```
### Continued development
Moreover I wanna start using CSS Custom Properties, Sass and focus on CSS Grid.
Really eager to learn Javascript as soon as possible.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) - Kevin Helped me to make my websites responsive, to get over my fear and start creating the real projects. Basically I have learned everything about css from him, he's a life-saver.
